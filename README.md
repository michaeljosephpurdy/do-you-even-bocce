# Do You Even Bocce?

## Overview

A **Playdate** game where you play bocce ball ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocce)).

## Vertical Slice

You have a match against a (CPU) opponent.
There is one 'jack' ball, and each player gets 4 'bocce' balls.

Random participant (aka: you or computer) start by throwing jack ball.
Then take turns throwing your balls, trying to get as close to jack ball as you can.

During each players turn they will:

* move their player
  * limited to specific _throw zone_.
* set direction of their throw
  * input direction with crank (or with d-pad)
* set power of their throw
  * time their button press with dynamic progress bar
* (potentially) set spin on their throw
